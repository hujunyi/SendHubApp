SendHubApp
====

This is the coding task from SendHub. This app uses it's APIs to implement adding contacts, editing contacts and send message.
I used backbone.js as front-end framework(written in coffeescript) and Rails as a proxy server(to get around CROS issue).

Environments
-
* ruby 2.1
* Rails 4.1.2

How to use
-
Before use this app, you have to go to [SendHub](https://www.sendhub.com) to sign up an account and get your APIKey.
```
bundle 
rails s
```
go to http://localhost:3000 in your browser
